        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a house music producer and DJ. I use the moniker Shōdan. I am from East New York, Brooklyn, NYC. Instead of turning to the streets that where full of crime and corruption. I used music as my escape.</p>
        <p>I fell in love in love with house music during the golden era of the Paradise Garage and the Paladium. I had a few chances to become something more that an avid fan. But, I choice corporate America. (Health care insurance makes for a complelling argument.)</p>
        <p>Serveral years later here I am. Making and mixing the music I wanted to make decades ago.</p>
        
        <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
        <p>Most recently, I released an EP, called <em>When Love Calls</em>, on BBop Music on January 5, 2024.</p>
        <p>Here is the link to <em>When Love Calls</em> on <a href="https://www.beatport.com/release/when-love-calls/4254880">Beatport</a>.</p>
